Hello,

We have a flash based website and we need to make some changes to it. This is the site: www.zensparetreat.com

The changes we need are the following:

- Add "s" to the Spa treatment menu item (i.e. Spa Treatment"s")
- Remove "skin boosters" from menu and also unpublish the skin booster treatments page. Also, remove the skin booster options from the gift certificate and online appointment webforms.
- On the facial skin therapies page, remove the Addons. These addons also need to be removed from the Gift certificate and online appointment webforms. Also, add the following treatments below the Deep clean treatment:

Moisture Up Intensive Hydrating Booster to plump skin cells with extra moisture. AHA Peel included. 55 min. $165

Firm Up Intensive Collagen Firming Booster to increase skin's elasticity and firmness. AHA Peel included. 55 min. $165

SPECIAL NEEDS:

Glyco Peel AHA Brightening Facial Peel $55

Eye S.O.S. Anti-Aging Eye Contour Treatment $55

Eye Depuff Anti-Puffiness and Dark Circles Eye Treatment $65

Neck Lift Lifting and Revitalizing Neck Treatment $75 

Those treatments also need to be added to the gift certificate and online appointment webforms.

The gift certificate webform is tied to the e-commerce so that when a user fills out the certificate information and submits the credit card info, they are charged. Therefore, these new products that we are adding to the certificate webform need to obviously be properly tied into the e-commerce so that they can be purchased and the user can be charged the correct prices.
